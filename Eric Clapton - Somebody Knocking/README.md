# Somebody's knocking - Intro, guitar tablature

This is my trascription attempt of the intro of an amazing song,
originally written by JJ Cale, and performed live by Eric Clapton during
"Slowhand at 70" at the Royal Albert Hall.

It is definitely one of my favourite Clapton's interpreations and you
can enjoy the full song on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/OR0bGCFTO6E?t=37).
